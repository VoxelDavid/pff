## Project Final Farewell: A Roblox Project

Project Final Farewell (PFF) was originally planned as a recreation of my old
game [Island Tycoon](http://www.roblox.com/Island-Tycoon-place?id=15541427).

At this point I have no direction as to what I want to make anymore. Currently
this repository is a placeholder for something in the future.


### Setup:

These are the directories you will encounter in the project:

	build        : Game files primarily for running tests.
	build/models : Models used in the game.
	src          : All of the Scripts used throughout the game.
	  global     : Scripts making use of the _G table.
	  gui        : Scripts used in Guis.

Run the following commands to get a local copy of the Wiki on GitHub:

	$ submodule init
	$ submodule update


### Contributing:

I encourage you to take a look through everything I have up here on GitHub and
to send me pull requests with things I could improve on.

I've made sure to document the code I've worked on the most so its easier to get
started. :)

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/VoxelDavid/pff/wiki) for (hopefully)
comprehensive guides on some of the important subjects to help you understand
what's going on.
