### Project Final Farewell: A Roblox Project
Project Final Farewell (PFF) is a full recreation of my old game [Island Tycoon](http://www.roblox.com/Island-Tycoon-place?id=15541427).
It was my most successful game and really bad in terms of design and code. It can and should be much better.

Currently I lack motivation and any sort of inspiration to even get this started,
but I figured I should atleast make it easier on myself by getting some basic
stuff setup on a Git repository and putting it up on GitHub for people interested.

You can view the game in it's current state at [MonsterBone's](http://www.roblox.com/User.aspx?ID=4374986) Roblox account.
The updated version will be put up on [MBPreviews](http://www.roblox.com/User.aspx?ID=5626931).
Once the game is complete I'll either put up the old version for download or move it to MBPreview's place.

#### Planned Features:
+ Abolish VIP.
	+ Give some sort of compensation to those that bought the old VIP shirts.
	+ Check the players inventory to see if they own them instead of if they're wearing them.
+ Universal Button script.
+ Upgrade buttons.
+ Some Hub for players to meet at.
