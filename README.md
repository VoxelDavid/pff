## Project Final Farewell: A Roblox Project
Project Final Farewell (PFF) was originally planned as a recreation of my old game [Island Tycoon](http://www.roblox.com/Island-Tycoon-place?id=15541427).

At this point I have no directory as to what I want to make anymore. Currently this repository is a placeholder for something in the future.

### Setup:

These are the directories you will encounter in the project:

	models   : Models used in the game.
	places   : Places with any number of scripts/models, primarily for running tests.
	scripts  : All of the Scripts used throughout the game. (This folder is for non-global Scripts)
	  global : Scripts making use of the _G table.
	  gui    : Scripts used in Guis.

Run the following commands to get a local copy of the Wiki:

	$ submodule init
	$ submodule update

### Contributing:
I encourage you to take a look through everything I have up here on GitHub and to send me pull requests with things I could improve on.

I've made sure to document the code I've worked on the most so its easier to get started. :)

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/VoxelDavid/pff/wiki) for (hopefully) comprehensive guides on some of the important subjects to help you understand what's going on
