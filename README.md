## RBX.Lua Dump

This is a Lua code repository written specifically for the [RBX](http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=RBX.Lua_Glossary) Lua variation. Originally intended to be a game, it is now a generic repository of code for use in future projects.

### Contributing

I encourage you to take a look through everything I have up here on GitHub and to send me pull requests with things I could improve on.

I'm documenting my code to the best of my abilities, so I hope it's easy to follow what I've done.
