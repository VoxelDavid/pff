## Project Final Farewell: A Roblox Project

Project Final Farewell (PFF) was originally planned as a recreation of my old game [Island Tycoon](http://www.roblox.com/Island-Tycoon-place?id=15541427).

At this point I have no direction as to what I want to make anymore. Currently this repository is a placeholder for something in the future.

I'm mainly just coding cool stuff with it and trying out different techniques.

## Contributing:

I encourage you to take a look through everything I have up here on GitHub and to send me pull requests with things I could improve on.

I'm documenting my code to the best of my abilities, so I hope it's easy to follow what I've done.
